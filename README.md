Credits to the repo creator above. I modified the codes and trained a more accurate model for the detection.

This project aims to look at users facial expression to detect emotions. The model is trained on a large classified image dataset with different expressions. With the trained model, the openCV code would run and overlay the predictions on the screen.

## To run
1. Clone, extract and note down the directory the file it is in
2. go to terminal and `cd` to the directory of the project
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. run `py video.py`
